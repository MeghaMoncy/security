# OSG-SEC-2025-12-04 CRITICAL React Server Components Vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182)

Dear OSG Security Contacts,

A pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability exists in React Server Components. The vulnerable code unsafely deserializes payloads from HTTP requests to Server Function endpoints.

## IMPACTED VERSIONS:

19.0.0,
19.1.0,
19.1.1,
19.2.0,


## Affected Packages

react-server-dom-parcel,
react-server-dom-turbopack,
react-server-dom-webpack,



## WHAT IS THE VULNERABILITY:

The vulnerability stems from unsafe deserialization logic used by React Server Components. An attacker can send a maliciously crafted serialized payload in an HTTP request to a Server Function endpoint. When React deserializes this payload, it may create unintended objects or trigger unexpected execution paths, enabling pre-authentication remote code execution on the server.
This vulnerability does not affect client-side React applications, and only impacts applications that use React Server Components on the server.
## Impact
An unauthenticated remote attacker could:
Execute arbitrary code on the server
Access or manipulate data processed by server-side React functions
Compromise the hosting environment
Potentially pivot deeper into infrastructure


Because this vulnerability requires no authentication and may be reachable through public endpoints, it is considered Critical.
## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
Patched versions have been released. All users of the affected packages must upgrade immediately.
19.0.1,
19.1.2,
19.2.1,
Additionally, if you are a user of a React based component such as Next.js, React Router, Expo, Redwood SDK, or Waku, please check the react.dev link below for upgrade instructions.
